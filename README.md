java-micro-benchmarking
=======================

Several simple benchmarks to illustrate the use of Caliper.

You can import the project as a Maven Project in Eclipse using m2e or just running "mvn eclipse:eclipse" to generate Eclipse project files and then import as an Existing Java Project.

Each micro-benchmark has a corresponding test. You can just run each test to execute the benchmark and see the results on the console.
